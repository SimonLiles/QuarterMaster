 Profile model structure holds the pantry and shopping list together so that a profile can be shared with other devices.
 
 - ```name: String``` is the name of the profile object and acts as an indentifier for the user
 
 - ToDo: Include more structure to allow for sharing functionality, consider permissions, allowed devices, etc.
