/**
 The backbone of the pantry inventory management software, the PantryItem model. The PantryItem model is subclassed as Codable,  Equatable, and Hashable, thus allowing it to be encoded, decoded, equated, and be used as a key in dictionaries.
 
 - Variables: a pantryItem has a name, category, location, current quantity, needed quantity, units, a note, and a purchase status
    - name: String, name of the item
    - category: String, Category the item belongs to
    - location: String, Where the item is stored
    - currentQuantity: Double, How much of the item is currently being stored
    - neededQuantity: Double, How much of the item is needed, defaults to 1
    - units: String, How the amount of the item is measured
    - note: String, Allows user to add notes regarding the item
    - purchaseStatus: PurchaseStatus, Indicates wether an item has been purchased, canceled, or needs to be bought. Defualts to `.toBuy`
 
 
 - Important: Initialization of the PantryItem object can only be done with a name, category, location, currentQuantity, units, and the note, the other values must be set outside of the initializer
